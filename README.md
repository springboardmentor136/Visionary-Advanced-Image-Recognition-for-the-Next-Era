# Visionary-Advanced-Image-Recognition-for-the-Next-Era
This project is a real-time face recognition authentication system using Flask (Python) for the backend and React for the frontend. It leverages deep learning-based face embeddings to identify users based on their facial features in live video streams.

## Features
 - Real-time face authentication using WebSocket (Socket.IO)
 - Registration of new users with name and image
 - Image-based face recognition using facial embeddings
 - Fast and accurate recognition with smooth frontend integration
 - Uses FaceNet model via DeepFace for high-quality embeddings
 - Frontend built with React using face-api.js for capturing and sending images

## Technologies Used
 - Backend: Flask, Flask-SocketIO
 - Frontend: React, face-api.js, Socket.IO-client
 - Model: FaceNet (for generating facial embeddings)
